# Python Projects Using the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course on Udemy
This repo consists of all the code I'll be making using the course above.

Update: I have reached day 23. The code beyond this point was getting quite complex and I think the projects deserve their own repos. I will not be pushing my updates to this repo any longer.
